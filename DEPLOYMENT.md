## 📝 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test the application locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- [ ] Check that environment variables are documented
- [ ] Verify that the app works without Firebase (uses localStorage)
- [ ] Test all user flows (Donor, Volunteer, NGO)
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on mobile

## 🔧 Build Configuration

The project is configured for:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **Node Version**: 18.x or higher (recommended)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output**: Standard Next.js output

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **LocalStorage Limitation**: The app currently uses localStorage for data storage. This means:
   - Data is stored in the user's browser
   - Data won't persist across different devices
   - For production, consider migrating to a database (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)

2. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Firebase is optional (app works without it)
   - Google Maps is optional (app uses mock location service)
   - All features work with localStorage fallback

3. **Build Issues**: If you encounter build errors locally:
   - Try deploying directly to Vercel (they handle builds in their environment)
   - The space in folder name "ZERO FOOD HERO" might cause issues locally but not on Vercel

## 🎯 Post-Deployment

1. Test all features on the live site
2. Monitor error logs in Vercel dashboard
3. Set up custom domain (optional) in Vercel settings
4. Enable analytics if needed

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:
- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check Next.js documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment
